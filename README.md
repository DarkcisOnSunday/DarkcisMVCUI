# Darkcis MVC UI

A modular UI architecture package for Unity built around MVC principles.

This package provides a set of reusable UI components and foundational structures for scalable interface development. It is designed to be imported as a lightweight extension into any Unity project, without enforcing a full project layout.

## Included Components

- **ButtonAsToggle**  
  A custom toggle implementation based on Unity's `Button`, designed for flexibility and modern UI behavior.

- **ValueContainer<T>**  
  A generic state holder used to encapsulate UI state and enable clean synchronization between data and visuals.

## Architectural Philosophy

- **MVC-Oriented**  
  Encourages clear separation between data (Model), logic (Controller), and presentation (View).

- **Composable and Minimal**  
  Components are designed to be minimalistic, readable, and easily reusable.

- **Framework-Agnostic**  
  Flexible design that doesn't enforce a specific architectural framework, allowing easy integration into existing codebases.

More components and architectural utilities will be added as the package evolves.
